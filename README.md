This is a first publishing of data from Sacramento Steps Forward data on the Sacramento Regional Homeless population and continuum of Care for dates from approximately 2011 through Fall of 2019.

# Notes

@kaimantsch: These are a few helpful notes Chris gave us about the data at the 2020-01-08 Code4Sac meetup.

- Anything before 2015 is not considered reliable data
- The Service table is not considered usable
